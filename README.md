# WoW Birthday Card Generator

World of Warcraft Birthday Card Generator is a full-stack app that allows anyone to easily customize a birthday card based on Level Up characteristics of a World of Warcraft character. 

The application scrappes images from World of Warcraft characters profiles, and generates a customizable card that can be used for any occasion (e.g level ups as birthdays, new skills, etc).

Developed with React, Material-UI, Node.js, Puppeteer for WebScraping, Jimp for image manipulation;

Back-end was mostly finished, but currently not working with the changes done by Blizzard to their images (backgrounds are now .webp, which are not supported by Jimp) and lack of time to finish.

The development of the frontend application was initiated but never finished.
